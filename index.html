<h1>Brief Introduction</h1>

<h3>Welcome to Coral County Roleplay</h3>

<p>Coral County Roleplay is a rapidly growing roleplay community available on roblox for PC players. Coral County Roleplay is a game set in California, United States. The reason our development team picked out this location is because of the tropical and desert-like environment which can make the game have a unique atmosphere. <br> Coral County Roleplay has tons of amazingly-designed infrastructure to show off, aswell as the beautiful landscape surrounding it.</p>

<h1>New Player Guide</h1>
<p>We know that new players may find it difficult to play our game. That's why we have created a system for players to get to know the game's mechanics.</p>
<h2>Step One: Getting Money</h2>
<p>In order to get a car, you need to have a job. You can start earning money using these civilian jobs.</p>
<p>
- Delivery Driver = $1 every 1 second
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Step two: Purchasing and Spawning Vehicles</h2>
<p>All players need to purchase a vehicle before they can spawn it. You need money for this (view step one for information on how to make money)</p>
<br>
<h4>Where are the vehicle spawners?</h4>
<p>You can find the vehicle spawners relatively close to your team spawn. They are usually the same color as your team.</p>

<h1>Revamped Emergency Vehicle Controls</h1>
<p>As we continue to revamp vehicles, their controls change.</p>
<p>
J = Activate Lights<br>
R = Activate Wail Siren<br>
T = Activate Yelp Siren<br>
G = Activate Priority Siren<br>
Y = Activate Automatic Siren<br>
H (while no siren is activated) = Activate Manual Siren (hold)<br>
H (while a siren is activated) = Horn<br>
F = Horn<br>
- = Activate Primary Dual Siren<br>
= = Activate Secondary Dual Siren<br>
[ = Activate Alley Lights<br>
] = Activate TakeDown Lights<br>
