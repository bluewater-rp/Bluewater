<h1>Brief Introduction</h1>

<h3>Welcome to Coral County Roleplay</h3>

<p>Coral County Roleplay is a rapidly growing roleplay community available on roblox for PC players. Coral County Roleplay is a game set in California, United States. The reason our development team picked out this location is because of the tropical and desert-like environment which can make the game have a unique atmosphere. <br> Coral County Roleplay has tons of amazingly-designed infrastructure to show off, aswell as the beautiful landscape surrounding it.</p>
