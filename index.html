    <h1>Our Rules</h1><br>
    <h3>As a community, we need to make sure that everyone is treated fairly. This is why we have rules.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
ðŸ‘‰ No Intent to Role Play (NITRP) is not tolerated. This is an RP server, players are here to RP, not to do GTA driving, have RDM and VDM, NITRP is not tolerated and strictly enforced.
No VDM VDM is randomly going around in a vehicle and ramming or crashing into people for no reason and with no RP purpose. It is not allowed.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ No RDM RDM is randomly going around shooting, punching or attacking other players with no RP purpose. It is not allowed.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ No FailRP FailRP occurs when characters in an RP scene break character, or do things that are not correct RP. This includes reviving after being killed, changing or re-spawning cars or any other action which is nor part of the RP scene. FailRP will result in Kick or Ban.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ New Life Rule (NLR) - We enforce a lite version of NLR, if you die, you can continue being your character, but you should not remember or go after anyone in a previous RP scene where you died. You should not have any memory of the events, and act as though it did not happen.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Fear for Life: you should have a healthy and realistic fear for your life in RP. This means if someone points a gun at you you would react with the same "fear" you would in real life that you do not want to be killed.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Fear/Respect of Law Enforcement or Services/Civilians: You should act as if you respect and have a good fear of Law Enforcement (police), i.e. you don't want to get caught or in trouble with the police. You should not usually rob police as this would not happen IRL, and you are not allowed to have any weapon or item that would belong only to the police, you are allowed (if you do rob a cop) to take non police weapons, and ammo, but nothing more, not even money.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ No GTA Driving - GTA driving is driving at excessive speeds all of the time, crashing into objects, other cars or other players for no RP Purpose. It is not allowed.
<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Under no circumstance are users to roleplay disrespectfully around any of the memorial sites, these are clearly posted. This includes climbing over them, driving around them, having shootouts around them or anything that may be considered disrespectful. Going against this rule is an instant permanent ban (no questions asked).
